# git_those_slides
Turn a Git repo into a set of slides, commit by commit.

## rai·son d'ê·tre /ˌrāzôn ˈdetrə/

I've wanted to make this for a long time and finally did (in haste). I usually create example repos for talks I do and I make a strong effort to make the commits read as steps, as if I were going through slides. So why not take the diffs, commit to commit, and use those in the slides themselves? With too many commits, the process becomes daunting. So here we are.

Additionally, I'm also walking through the target repo locally and stopping to take another screen shot of the webpage that is generated (my most recent usecase was for a Javascript library.)

## Disclaimer!
I'm totally not done here! Probably don't use this! I'll be keeping a short and sweet set of [issues](https://github.com/mikedillion/git_those_slides/issues) to get this fleshed out per my original idea. Then maybe this disclaimer will come down.
